    <h3>ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>500g orechiette</li>
        <li>300g freshly grated Pecorino Romano</li>
        <li>One bunch fresh broccoli rabe, stems trimmed</li>
        <li>500g fresh Italian sausage</li>
        <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a pot with ample water and put on high heat to boil.</li>
        <li>Chop up the sausage into bite sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat up olive oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>When the oil is hot, sprinkle a pinch of red pepper flakes into the hot oil. Let simmer for 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Once the pepper flakes have released their flavor into the oil, put the sausage in the pan and cook until it is lightly browned.</li>
        <li>When the water comes to a boil, dump the brocoli rabe in the water and blanche for 30 seconds. Set aside and let cool on a cutting board.</li>
        <li>Liberally salt the water and return to a roiling boil.</li>
        <li>Dump the pasta in the boiling water and cook until al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, chop up the broccoli rabe and toss with the sausage in the hot pan.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is almost cooked, set aside 1 cup of pasta water and drain the past in a colander.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pasta to the hot pan with the sausage and broccoli rabe. Pour in half of the pasta water and stir the contents of the pan.</li>
        <li>Let the pasta finish cooking in the pan. The starchy pasta water should give the whole dish a creamy texture. Use more pasta water if so desired.</li>
        <li>Transfer contents of pan to a serving bowl. Serve immediately with ample grated Pecorino.</li>
    </ol>
